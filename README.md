# Introduction

The proposal this document brings up is the need to have an agreement on identifying key areas in order to form consensus around. This document does not propose a messaging protocol but instead tries to highlight some of the items which might help us to start conversations around what is needed to initiate the work to look into possibilities to switch to event driven CI/CD from the traditional timer/polling based CI/CD, helping us to establish federation of CI/CD Systems.

The prototype accompanying the proposal aims to demonstrate how CI/CD Systems developed, maintained and operated across different open source communities can be enabled to communicate with each other with event broadcasting.
