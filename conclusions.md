# Conclusions

As stated throughout this document, this prototype aims to demonstrate the challenges in E2E Integration and Testing we as open source communities face and start the conversation around evolving CI/CD Systems our communities use to support event driven CI/CD and CI/CD Federation.  


The impacts of this on community CI/CD Systems are pretty limited but may well result in benefits for the wider ecosystem. The ideas represented here could enable us to continue establishing common vocabulary within open source ecosystem supported by a messaging protocol, resulting in creation of a layer across open source communities which acts like a glue between CI/CD Systems.
