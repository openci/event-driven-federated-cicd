# The Proposal

As highlighted in the previous chapter, event driven architecture provides solutions for \(some of\) the challenges we as open source communities face in CI/CD. By using event broadcasting and federated approach, CI/CD Systems developed, operated, and used by the communities can address the challenges they may be facing when it comes E2E Integration and Testing and with the CI/CD Flows that span across multiple communities.  


The proposal is to

* develop and standardize a messaging protocol in an open and collaborative manner
* introduce the federation concept so the community CI/CD Systems can and will be able to continue to be developed and operated in same fashion and independently
* ensure the community CI/CD Systems adhere to the messaging protocol
* implement/enable what the messaging protocol and federation require on community CI/CD Systems
